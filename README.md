# Recipes
This is a HTML starter project for the Odin Project. The goal of the Recipe project is to create a simple index page which links to a few recipes. This will form th basis of future additions and styling via CSS.

## Side Objective
Apart from the directives of the Odin Project, it is hoped that this will form the underpinnings from which to extract a resuable system to readily create an easy to adapt modern, elegant yet fully formed HTML file. This will also be hoped to served as a illustrative example to be used for teaching purposes.
